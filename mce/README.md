This directory contains the sources of MCE, a Command Line Editor for
RSX180.

This version of MCE is derived from the similar application submitted by J.
H. Hamakers to the DECUS library. MCE in turn is derived from CLE, originally
written by D. Sponza and further modified by Steven L. Joben, David C. Guelet,
and others.
