SUBJ:	TREK, Startrek Game for the VT52/VT100

TREK is a variant of SPCWAR (or STRTRK) which uses the cursor features
of the VT52 and VT100 to produce better displays.

This version of TREK is based on numerous previous versions, starting
with a baselevel written by Aron Insinga.  The modifications for the
VT52/VT100 were made by J. Thompson.  The master game was added by
R. Supnik.

I.  Introduction

As captain of the Federation starship ENTERPRISE, your mission is to
destroy all the Klingon battle cruisers in the galaxy, using as few
moves (stardates) as possible.  To this end, the ENTERPRISE is armed
with photon torpedos, as well as the famous phasers.  You can search
for the Klingons using your long range sensors as you move through the
galaxy.  You are also provided with at least one starbase where you
may replenish your supply of torpedos and energy.

II.  Display

The left hand display is the galaxy, which is divided into 64 quadrants,
each of which is further divided into 64 sectors.  The quadrant with an
E indicates the location of the ENTERPRISE.   All other quadrants are
initially unknown.  Through the use of the long range sensors, the
number and types of all objects in the galaxy can be discovered.  When
a quadrant has been scanned, its contents are indicated with a three
digit number.  The left hand digit represents the number of Klingon
battle cruisers, the middle digit the number of starbases, the right
hand digit the number of stars.  For example, 319 indicates 3 Klingon
battle cruisers, 1 starbase, and 9 stars.

The right hand display is a close up of the quadrant in which the
ENTERPRISE is currently located.  E represents the ENTERPRISE, K
represents a Klingon battle cruiser, and * represents a star.  Just
below the quadrant display is a display of important status variables,
such as the current location of the ENTERPRISE and the amount of energy
remaining.  Also displayed is the current alert condition:

	RED		Klingons in this quadrant
	ORANGE		Klingons in adjacent quadrant(s)
	YELLOW		Energy dangerously low
	GREEN		No threats
	DOCKED		Docked at STARBASE

III.  Commands

TREK recognizes nine commands:

	W-	Warp drive (maneuver the ENTERPRISE)
	L-	Long range scan
	S-	Short range scan
	P-	Phaser fire control
	T-	Torpedo fire control
	C-	Chart (rewrite) the entire screen
	D-	Damage control report
	B-	Battle analysis report
	E-	Early exit from game

   W-	TREK asks for the course and warp factor.  The course is a real
	number in the range 1 - 8.9999 and indicates the direction to
	travel, as marked on the compass in the middle of the screen.
	The warp factor is a real number in the range 1 - 12 and is
	the number of quadrants to be travelled.

   L-	TREK scans the eight quadrants immediately adjacent to the
	ENTERPRISE and updates the galaxy display accordingly.

   S-	TREK scans the quadrant in which the ENTERPRISE currently resides
	and updates the quadrant display accordingly.

   P-	Any portion of the ENTERPRISE's energy can be used to power the
	phasers.  The onboard computer divides this energy among the
	Klingon cruisers in the quadrant and determines the various
	directions of fire.  The effectiveness of phaser fire depends
	primarily on the distance to the target.  The amount of energy
	fired is deducted from the ENTERPRISE's energy pool.

   T-	Initially the ENTERPRISE has ten photon torpedos.  One torpedo
	destroys anything it hits, including Klingon battle cruisers,
	stars, and starbases.  The course of a torpedo is set the same
	way as for the ENTERPRISE.

   C-	TREK rewrites the entire display screen.

   D-	TREK outputs a report on the state of the major ENTERPRISE
	subsystems (see Master Game, below).

   B-	TREK analyses the location and strength of all Klingon battle
	cruisers in the quadrant.

   E-	TREK terminates the current game after printing a suitably snide
	remark.

IV.  Klingons

A Klingon battle cruiser starts with an energy allocation of 200 - 300 units.
It fires with all its force whenever attacked or whenever the ENTERPRISE
enters or leaves its quadrant.  Phaser firing does not deplete a
Klingon's energy pool;  however, a hit from the ENTERPRISE's phasers does.
When a Klingon's energy pool drops to zero or below, it is eliminated.

You win the game by eliminating all Klingon battle cruisers in the galaxy
within forty turns.  If you fail to eliminate all enemy cruisers, or if
at any time your own energy pool drops to zero or below, you lose.

V.  Master Game

As an option, at startup you may ask for the master game.  This differs
from the regular game in the following ways:

   -	The game length is 30 - 50 turns long (instead of 40).

   -	A Klingon battle cruiser starts with an initial energy allocation
	of 1000 - 1500 units.  However, it only fires 20% - 50% of its
	total allocation in any one turn, and the amount fired is
	deducted from its energy pool.

   -	On any movement turn, there is a 20% chance that some major
	subsystem of the ENTERPRISE will be damaged by a space storm.
	Damage may make the subsystem partially or totally nonfunctional.
	Damage is repaired gradually over the course of each subsequent
	movement turn or by docking with a starbase.

VI.  Sleeping

The amount of time delay following a printout is controlled by the delay
loop in statement 9030.  The time constant 4000 is approximately right
for an 11/45.  You should adjust it upward or downward as necessary for
your processor.
